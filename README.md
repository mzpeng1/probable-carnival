## Inspiration
We saw that the pandemic and remote work led to fewer opportunities for team members to get to know each other well, especially for new members who did not have the in-person onboarding experiences. This is in part due to the impersonal nature of online meetings, where it is difficult to make personal connections.

## Solution
To address this, we created a matching service where administrators can create questions for their organization. A matching algorithm based on similarities in response then assigns matches to users. This can be used to create personal connections within a team, as well as lead to greater team cohesion.

## Next Steps
In the future, we hope to add more customization options such as having the option for some questions favor different responses to add diversity to the matches, as well as a more transparent algorithm for users to see how they matched.

## Built With
MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
